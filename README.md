# Image Steganography

This project is a Python-based tool for encoding and decoding messages within images using steganography techniques. It utilizes the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method to hide messages in the RGB values of an image, providing a simple way to encrypt and conceal data.

## Features

- **Encode Messages**: Hide a message within an image using a password for encryption.
- **Decode Messages**: Retrieve hidden messages from an encoded image using the correct password.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for various error scenarios, such as invalid paths or incorrect passwords.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any platform that supports Python and the Pillow library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

You can install the Pillow library using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
